# WineQT-prediction
The goal of this project is to analyze and predict the quality of wine based on its chemical composition. By leveraging data visualization and machine learning, we aim to uncover patterns in the data and build models that can accurately classify wine quality. 

**Approach**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Visualized feature distributions and correlations with quality using scatterplots and barplots.
Observed trends like the positive correlation between alcohol and quality and the negative impact of high volatile acidity.

**Machine Learning Models:**
Built and evaluated Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to predict wine quality.
Used performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare models.

**Insights:**
Higher alcohol levels and lower volatile acidity often indicate higher wine quality.
Random Forest performed better overall due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships.

**Outcomes**

1.Gained insights into how chemical components affect wine quality.
2.Demonstrated the practical use of machine learning in the food and beverage industry.
3.Built predictive models that can classify wine quality with high accuracy.

**Applications**

This project has potential applications in:

**Winemaking:** Optimizing chemical composition during production.

**Quality Control:** Automated wine quality grading in wineries.

**Consumer Tools:** Developing apps to predict wine quality based on chemical properties.
